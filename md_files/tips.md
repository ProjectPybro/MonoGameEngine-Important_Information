# Random Tips
* Scaling the player inside MonoGameEngine will fuck up its collision. Try to export the image to the desired size instead.
* MonoGameEngine disables the console so Console.Write won't work. Use Debug.Write or Debug.WriteLine instead!
* The Camera is currently broken. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
